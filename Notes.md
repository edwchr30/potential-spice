Notes
================

I created this to document the work that I'm doing:
1. Writing Code
2. Research
3. Setup

I should have started earlier, but I wont back date.
If my memory was perfect, I wouldn't have to write
this all down.

Researched and played around trying to get my ssl syntax working properly.

Got my input loop functioning properly
  Mostly syntax error, which was much easier to 
  figure out one I stopped reading all about it
  and just did some debugging.
