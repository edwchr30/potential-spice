Python as a way of LIFE!
Homebrewed Homework: Part 1


Encryption Key Retrieval
========================

This program will highlight the versatility of python by using many methods
to accomplish a useful task.  I plan to accept a 16-byte string that is
entered by the user, return a cipher-text version that is unreadable, and 
then through the use of a key that has been retrieved from a Hardware 
Security Module display the unencrypted version.

Implementation
========================
1. Create file ptext.txt with 16 bytes of information.
2. Move the file to another directory.
3. Establish SSL connection to HSM.
4. Upload ptext.txt for encryption
5. Create a symmetrical key.
6. Demonstrate that ptext.txt is encrypted and also show decrypted version.
